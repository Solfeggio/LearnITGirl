     <h2><center>X</center></h2>

     <p><center>I DIED for beauty, but was scarce<br>
     	Adjusted in the tomb,<br>
     	When one who died for truth was lain<br>
     	In an adjoining room.<br>
     </p>
     <p>
     	He questioned softly why I failed?<br>
     	"For beauty," I replied<br>
     	"And I for truth,-the town are one;<br>
     	We brethren are," he said.<br>
     </p>
     <p>And so, as kinsmen met a night,<br>
     	We talked between the rooms,<br>
     	Until the moss had reached our lips,<br>
     	And covered up our names.</center><br>
     </p>
